ToolPhar is a new idea to install your development tools such as PHPUnit.
You can just add a few lines to your composer.json, and composer will automatically download the phar to your *vendor/bin* folder.

## How?
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Why?

Why is this necessary?
Well, currently there are several ways on how to install phpunit:

1. download the phar manually
1. include it as a dev-dependency in your composer project
1. use a tool like ant, phing, â€¦

At least from my points of view, none of these ways is perfect. I'm gonna explain why.


### Downloading the phars manually
This way makes getting started more complicated for new developers.
In addition, your developers will most likely have different versions of the tools.



Happy fun highlighting.
